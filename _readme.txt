I am used as a starting point for new android applications.

Manually clone this stub
    Copy the androidStub folder to the correct location.
    Rename the copied folder to match your project.
    Delete the .git subfolder.
    Open the .project file and change the project's <name>.
    Make sure to replace the default .gitignore and README.md files 
        that GitHub supplies with paragon's .gitignore and README.md.

At this point the application should compile and run.
    Confirm the app works.
    Review and commit the changes to git.

MyMainActivity.java
    Change the welcome message.
    Review and commit the changes to git.

MyPreferences.java
    Change the NAME to an app specific value.
    Review and commit the changes to git.
    
FIXME's
    Search for any remaining FIXME comments in the code.
    Make changes as directed.
    Review and commit the changes to git.
    
com.kodemore.stub (package)
    Rename the stub package...
        The simplest way to do this is via the eclipse tools.
            1) In the Package Explorer view, select the 'src' folder.
            2) In the Packages view, right click on the 'stub' package...
                    Select Refactor -> Rename
            3) When prompted, update references and rename subpackages.
    This package represents the actual application (not tests and tools)
        This package should:
            start with "com"
            enter your company name (accucode)
            end with a unique project name.
        E.g.: for a dog trainer app you might rename it to:
            com.accucode.dogTrainer
   *make sure that this was done for the stub.ui and stub.sql packages 
        if not repeat the above steps for stub.ui and stub.sql
    Review and commit the changes to git.

Rename the Application Package
    Don't do this manually.
    Select your project in the Project Explorer
    Right click and select
        Android Tools... Rename Application Package.
    Enter the same package location where you put MyApplication.java.
    Once this is done you may get a compile error in the RR.java file
        change the com.kodemore.stub to the same package location
        where you put MyApplication.java. 
            (the easiest way is to do a find/replace All)
    Review and commit the changes to git.
    
AndroidManifest.xml
    Change the application label.
        Search for the line "android:label="
        Change the value to a more appropriate value for your app.
        Review and commit the changes to git.
        
Delete the README.md file if it exists (it may not be there).
    This is generated by git and should be removed.
        Select your project in the Project Explorer.
        Right click on the README.md file 
        Select Delete

Create a new readme.txt file with basic application information
    application name
    application purpose
    liscence information
    version requirements (java, android API)
        
Delete this _readme.txt file from the new project.
